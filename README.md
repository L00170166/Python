## Python
## Python  Exercises from 2-5
## Assignment Scope
This assignment was to copy the Python exercise folders from week 2-5 to a GitHub repository (repo). A GitHub public repo was setup to include a readme file to explain about the repo. This was setup using best practise from the lecture’s notes. A branch was setup using *GitHub desktop* in GitHub called *Python-Dev*. The repo was clone to the local desktop using GitHub desktop. This was created in a local folder called Python.      
## The aims of this assignment 
1. Create a repo in GitHub called python.
2. Include a Readme file explaining about the repo.
3. Add gitignore for python to exclude unwanted bit code and not to include SSH keys.
4. Select a creative license, so the work is mark as ours.  
5. Create a branch in this repo for Dev work called *Python-Dev*.
6. Make some changes in your local repo which would push to *Python-Dev branch*. The readme file would be edited for this purpose. 
6. Using best practise enable Protect matching branches. 
7. Make some changes in your local repo and commit these to *Python-Dev branch* and then to *Python main*. 
## Method  #
For this part of the assignment a backup was taken of the Python exercise folder. In GitHub a repo called Python is created.  Git ignore was selected to ignore Python files and ignore SSH as in the instructors’ notes. A license was selected with the setting *Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal*. A readme file is selected to be created in the repo to be used later. *GitHub desktop* is downloaded to the local machine. From the repo in GitHub the URL is copied from the code menu and on GitHub desktop a clone is selected using the URL. A folder is created called Python on the desktop of the local machine and the clone repo is placed in this location. *Xcopy* is used to copy the PowerShell files into the local repo. In *GitHub desktop* the folders are committed to *Python repo*. Using Visual Studio Code (VSC) the readme file is opened from the repo and edited. From GitHub desktop a branch was created call *Python-Dev*. Using PowerShell *git logs* shows the newly creative Python-dev is now the *head*. Changes were made to the Readme file using VCS. In *GitHub desktop* and using PowerShell *git status* we can see changes are waiting to be committed. These were committed to *Python-Dev branch*. Once these changes are validated, they are committed to *Python main*. A *git push* is preform from GitHub desktop to GitHub. The changes could be seen in repo *branch* and not in repo *main*. Commit to main preformed in GitHub. 
In this assignment, GitHub and GitHub desktop were used to perform the main tasks. PowerShell was also used to run Git commands to confirm the status and analyse logs. GitHub desktop is a very useful tool and, but it can easily accidentally overwrite files. These files can be restored easily in the *stashed changes* or through PowerShell and Git commands.
